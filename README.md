### Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly _available_, in addition to restricting _traffic_ to the network. 

- What aspect of security do load balancers protect? 
  
  Answer: _Availability, Web Traffic, Web Security_

- What is the advantage of a jump box? 
  
  Answer: _Automation, Security, Network Segmentation, Access Control_

Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the _data_ and system _logs_.

- What does Filebeat watch for? _Filebeat monitors the log files or locations that you specify, collects log events, and forwards them either to Elasticsearch or Logstash for indexing._

- What does Metricbeat record? _Metricbeat takes the metrics and statistics that it collects and ships them to the output that you specify, such as Elasticsearch or Logstash._

The configuration details of each machine may be found below.
_Note: Use the [Markdown Table Generator](http://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) to add/remove values from the table_.

| Name                 | Function     | IP Address               | Operating System |
|----------------------|--------------|--------------------------|------------------|
| Jump-Box-Provisioner | Gateway      | 10.0.0.4 /52.242.18.55   | Linux            |
| Web1                 |Web Server    | 10.0.0.5                 | Linux            |
| Web2                 |Web Server    | 10.0.0.6                 | Linux            |
| ELK                  |ELK Server    | 10.1.0.4 /52.138.103.192 | Linux            |
| Load Balancer        |Load Balancer | Static External IP       | Linux            |
| Workstation          |Access Control| External IP or PublicIP  | Linux            |

- Follow this step below to create a Load Balancer for Web1 and Web2

  1. [Create a Load Balancer](https://github.com/flyrcs/Azure-Virtual-Network-with-ELK-Deployment/blob/master/Images/VM_Config_Screenshot/Create_Load_Balancer.png)

  2. [Create the Virtual Machines Web1 with Availability Set](https://github.com/flyrcs/Azure-Virtual-Network-with-ELK-Deployment/blob/master/Images/VM_Config_Screenshot/Availability_Set_Web1.jpg) 
  
  3. [Create the Virtual Machines Web2 with Availability Set](https://github.com/flyrcs/Azure-Virtual-Network-with-ELK-Deployment/blob/master/Images/VM_Config_Screenshot/Availability_Set_Web2.jpg)

  4. [Create Load Balancer Backend Pool and Add Web1 and Web2 Virtual Machine](https://github.com/flyrcs/Azure-Virtual-Network-with-ELK-Deployment/blob/master/Images/VM_Config_Screenshot/Backend_Pools_Add_Web1_and_Web2.jpg)

  5. [Create a Load Balancing Rule](https://github.com/flyrcs/Azure-Virtual-Network-with-ELK-Deployment/blob/master/Images/VM_Config_Screenshot/Load_Balancing_Rules.jpg)

  6. [Allow the AzureLoadBalacer Service in Security Group within the Virtual Network](https://github.com/flyrcs/Azure-Virtual-Network-with-ELK-Deployment/blob/master/Images/VM_Config_Screenshot/SecurityGroup_Allow_AzureLoadBalancer_in_Virtual_Network.jpg) 

- Follow this step to test the instances of the redundancy for Web1 and Web2 Virtual Machine. 
  1. Verify that the DVWA site is up and running and can be accessed from the web. 
     - Go to your Chrome browser and type http://[Load-Balancer-External-IP]/setup.php 
     - See this image if successful : [DVWA Redundancy Test](https://github.com/flyrcs/Azure-Virtual-Network-with-ELK-Deployment/blob/master/Images/VM_Config_Screenshot/DVWA_Testing_Redundancy.jpg)
  2. Turn off one of your VMs (Web1 or Web2) from the Azure portal. Confirm if you can still access the DVWA website.
  3. Finally turning off both VMs making sure there are no access. [See image](https://github.com/flyrcs/Azure-Virtual-Network-with-ELK-Deployment/blob/master/Images/VM_Config_Screenshot/DVWA_Test_Web1_Web2_OFF.jpg) 

### Access Policies

The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet. 

Only the _Elk Server_ machine can accept connections from the Internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the following IP addresses: 
- _Workstation Public IP through TCP 5601._

Machines within the network can only be accessed by _Workstation_ and _Jump-Box-Provisioner_.
Which machine did you allow to access your ELK VM? What was its IP address?
- _Jump-Box-Provisioner IP : 10.0.0.4 via SSH port 22_ 
- _Workstation Public IP via port TCP 5601_

A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below.

| Name        | Publicly Accessible  | Allowed IP Addresses                  |
|-------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Jump Box    |      No              | Workstation Public IP on SSH  22      |
|   Web1      |      No              | 10.0.0.4 on SSH  22                   |
|   Web2      |      No              | 10.0.0.4 on SSH  22                   |
|ELK Server   |      No              | Workstation Public IP using TCP  5601 |
|Load balancer|      No              | Workstation Public IP on  HTTP 80     |   

### Elk Configuration

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because _Ansible lets you quickly and easily deploy multitier apps. You won't need to write custom code to automate your systems; you list the tasks required to be done by writing a playbook, and Ansible will figure out how to get your systems to the state you want them to be in._

The playbook implements the following tasks:

- Specify a different group of machines as well as a different remote user 
    ```bash
      - name: Config elk VM with Docker
        hosts: elk
        remote_user: sysadmin
        become: true
        tasks:
    ``` 
- Increase System Memory :
    ```yaml
     - name: Use more memory
      sysctl:
        name: vm.max_map_count
        value: '262144'
        state: present
        reload: yes
    ```
- Install the following services:
    ```bash
       `docker.io`
       `python3-pip`
       `docker`, which is the Docker Python pip module.
    ``` 
- Launching and Exposing the container with these published ports:
    ```bash
     `5601:5601` 
     `9200:9200`
     `5044:5044`
    ```

The following screenshot displays the result of running `docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK instance. ![](Images/docker_ps_output.JPG) 
![](Images/Docker_PS_Ouput/docker_ps_output_Web1.jpg) 
![](Images/Docker_PS_Ouput/docker_ps_output_Web2.jpg)
  - The status should be up.

### Target Machines & Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines: 
 - Web1 : 10.0.0.5
 - Web2 : 10.0.0.6

We have installed the following Beats on these machines: 
 - ELK Server, Web1 and Web2
 - The ELK Stack Installed are: _FileBeat and MetricBeat_

These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:
 - Filebeat:    _log events_
 - Metricbeat:  _metrics and system statistics_
